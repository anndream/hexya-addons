Manage sales quotations and orders
==================================

This application allows you to manage your sales goals in an effective and efficient manner
by keeping track of all sales orders and history.

It handles the full sales workflow:

* **Quotation** -> **Sales order** -> **Invoice**

Preferences (only with Warehouse Management installed)
------------------------------------------------------

If you also installed the Warehouse Management, you can deal with the following preferences:

* Shipping: Choice of delivery at once or partial delivery
* Invoicing: choose how invoices will be paid
* Incoterms: International Commercial terms

You can choose flexible invoicing methods:

* *On Demand*: Invoices are created manually from Sales Orders when needed
* *On Delivery Order*: Invoices are generated from picking (delivery)
* *Before Delivery*: A Draft invoice is created and must be paid before delivery


The Dashboard for the Sales Manager will include
